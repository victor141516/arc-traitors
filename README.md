## 🛡️ Community Guidelines

### For Reporters:

✅ **DO:**

- Report genuine incidents of betrayal or trolling
- Include clear descriptions of what happened
- Use accurate player names
- Help build a better community

❌ **DON'T:**

- Make false reports
- Use the system for revenge or harassment
- Report someone for minor mistakes
- Spam multiple reports

### Fair Play:

Remember that everyone makes mistakes. The system is designed to identify patterns of bad behavior, not to punish single incidents. If a player is truly problematic, multiple community members will report them independently.
